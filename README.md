# whiteboard_pi
A repo for my CS490 thesis project "robotic whiteboad" - which holds the home directory of the pi.

This project is heavily based upon the Polargraph project by Sandy Noble 2015.
Found here: https://github.com/euphy/polargraphcontroller/tree/2017-11-01-20-30

This repo holds the home directory of the rasberry pi - so acts as a form of back up as well.
It holds the two main code bases, the pi and the arduino.
